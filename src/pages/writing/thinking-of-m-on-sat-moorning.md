<poem>
I woke up this moorning at quarter to six,<br/>
I dressed and left the house in a haste,<br/>
Before the hour hand turned to six;<br/>
But my jeans were slipping down my waist!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I went back home and put on my belt,<br/>
And soon thereafter left again,<br/>
Relieved that I no longer felt,<br/>
That my jeans were sliding off my frame.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought about you and your dad with a smile,<br/>
As I turned on Saint Laurant and found,<br/>
That coffee shops would remain shut for a whileâ€”<br/>
Too bad. I guess I'll just have to wait.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Turning East I went towards where,<br/>
I knew there was some nature there.<br/>
Towards the foot of Mont Royal,<br/>
After which is christened Montreal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She stood there unperterbed as I,<br/>
With my little legs, walked up her spine;<br/>
She revealed a large bird close to my eye,<br/>
Who's wingspan was over half of mine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There came after half a mile or so,<br/>
Thin sheets of ice on shallow mud-puddles,<br/>
And with a smile I had a go,<br/>
At their surfaces, crackling under my gait.<br/>
