<poem>
I used to live at the barrier of Fuha,<br/>
In my penthouse I would stay,<br/>
Stoking the fire throughout the winter,<br/>
Cold travellers would enter.<br/><br/>
To tell their tales over a bowl<br/>
Of hot soup and a bottle of sake,<br/>
Like moths to th' moon they where drawn,<br/>
By smoke from the chimney.<br/><br/>
Whether surrounded by naked tress and snow,<br/>
Or in pink hues of cherry blossoms,<br/>
My home stood perfectly still.<br/>
Alas that was long ago.
</poem>

This poem was inspired by 

<poem>No one lives at the barrier of Fuha,<br/>
The wooden penthouse is fallen away,<br/>
All that remains --<br/>
Is the autumn wind.</poem>
