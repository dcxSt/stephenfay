### A subset of the people of Columbae in an alternate universe, 1937 UK

Nancy had been growing increasingly weary of her new husband Arpie Young. Even though they where married their relationship was closer to that of high-school sweethearts. The more she got to know him the more she felt her husband was a stranger. They had stumbled too hurredly into their marriage because their friends had been so keen about the match. She was the daughter of a Lieutenant General, and he was a celebrity RAF pilot. 

Other than their good looks, outward charm, and being in the army they had very little in common. Arpie thought of women in the army as pretty flowers whose purpose was to lighten their superiors' mood. He had grown up poor and was highly supersticious. He denied this fervently but Nancy knew that he slept with a fortune telling book under his pillow, and that he frequented a palm reader. Nancy had a shrewed wit, was not supersticious, and had been spoiled by her rich father. 

They had met at an army dance. Arpie had brazenly stepped between Nancy and another potential suitor, and asked her if he could have the pleasure of dancing with her. Their synergy was immediately apparent to all. They where the best looking couple in the room. Most of the women in the room where inexperianced dancers, having been sheltered by their parents, but Nancy's father often hosted balls for officials and Nancy had had plenty of practice growing up. As they danced together they got lost in each others' gaze, they didn't notice that they where the last ones left on stage as the band finished the song. Everyone else had stepped off it to admire them. When the song ended everyone shouted and cheered them on. 

Arpie lived with his wealthy brother Adonnis Young and his wife Ellie Young. Arpie and Adonnis had grown up poor but Adonnis, who was much older than Arpie, had successfully ascended the ranks of the railway industry after publishing a book arguing for taxcuts for the railway companies. Adonnis and Arpie where descendants of a line of French protestant Huganots who had fled France in the 1600s to escape catholic persecution. After her marriage Nancy had moved in with her hasband who was living at Adonnis and his wife Ellie's house. 

One day Ellie over heard Nancy complaing about the food to her maid "This fish stinks! Did you just fry it in sunflower oil? There's no hint of wine or lemon juice." Ellie became paranoid that Nancy was trying to take control of her domain. "I will not have her impetuously ordering my servant around" she complained to her husband. 

After that incident Ellie had grown increasingly hostile toward Nancy. For her part Nancy was desperately trying to convince Arpie to get a place of his own. But Arpie was a young man and had other things on his mind. Although he was married he still felt like a bachelor. He told his wife that he would look for a house for them to rent but had made no attempt to find one. 

To make matters worse, the distinguished Sir. Jason, professor of French litterature at Imperial Colledge and a friend of Adonnis, had fallen hopelessly in love with Nancy. He had met her for the first time at her wedding with Arpie, which Adonnis had invited him to. It was love at first sight. For a time he kept his feelings private, she was married, she was way too young for him. Eventually he could no longer restrain himself from writing to her. He was completely smitten. This newfound love had re-kindled in him the passion of his youth. 

It was an open secret that Jason was an old hand in the game of love and a shameless womanizer. He had spent ten years in France and roumour had it that he frequented brothels wherever he travelled, so Nancy didn't take his soliciting seriously. She truely had no interest in this wayward professor, but her husband, and all those around her could not help but suspect that she was egging him on. Why else would he persist in sending her so many love letters? 

Jason's letters had caught the attention of the postman, Tuesday, who was a terrible gossip. Word of Nancy's daily letters spread like wildfire throughout their neighbourhood, Columbae. 

Nancy put yet another of her letters onto the large stack that she kept in the chest of draws. Rather than burn them, she kept them as evidence that she had not betrayed her husband, they where ridiculous. And there was no denying that she found comfort in his flattery. Jason sometimes included poems to add to his heartful outpourings of love. 

*Sweet Nancy, fire of my soul, 
I am a tree in the dezert and you are thirst-quenching moisture,
Sweet Nancy, bringer of life, 
I am lost at sea and you are the shore on the horizon,
Sweet Nancy, you are my everything.*

*I do not ask that you return my love, only that you accept it. Si tu pouvais lire dans mon coeur, tu verrais la place où je t’ai mis! Tu est ma mie, tu est mon espoir. Sans toi la vie serait sans sens.*

Nancy denied it but she did find comfort in his flattery. After all, everyone likes being wanted. 

That evening, Ellie and Adonis' shouting match could be heard from Nacy and Arpie's chamber. "How long can we possibly keep on tolerating these absurd love letters! I do not understand why you stick up for this shameless man." Ellie yelled at her husband. "He is a scoundrel! Flies are only attracted to cracked eggs. She's spoiling our good name --you think people haven't noticed that stupid postman walking up our drive every single day? We're the laughing stock of the neighbourhood."

Nancy could not contain her anger and made a beeline for the door, she would show her who the cracked egg was. Arpie held her back by the arm, "Don't you dare challenge your sister in law's authority in her own house!" he whispered threteningly. Nancy broke free of his grip and lunged for the door handle. Completely overcome by rage, she sprinted out of her chamber and burst in Adonnis' room, slamming the double doors open. 

"You!" she yelled at Ellie "I don't have anything to do with that professor, and I don't want anything to do with you or your servants, how dare you slander me!". 

She was followed shortly thereafter by a panic strickend Arpie, who grabbed her by the arm again and scolded her "The guts you have breaking into my brother's room, how can you be so shameless, you must apologise at once." Nancy was shocked and hurt that her husband had picked the other side. 

Arpie's statement stoked Ellie's hot rage and before she could think twice she ruthlessly blurted out "How dare you act like the master of this house you whore!" She had gone a step too far. Adonnis, who had thus far been relatively composed was horrified, he stepped in and slapped his wife hard across the face. After a second of pure shock Ellie's legs gave way and she started crying profusely in a heap on the ground. It wasn't the physical pain of that hurt. In their twelve years of marriage Ellie had never been struck by her husband and with this blow she felt like her heart had been struck by lightning. She had supported him through thick and thin, she had borne him two children, she was a faithful and devoted wife, and now Adonnis was siding with his brother's poor mannered wench!

It was at this inopportune time what the Young's doorbell sounded five times. Jason had not recieved so much as a single word of acknowledgement from Nancy who refused to answer any of his letters, not even to reject him, for this would mean admitting to him that she had read them. He had started to worry that she was not even recieving them, and so he had decided to pay her a visit. He knew very well that he couldn't just show up to the Young's doorstep uninvited, so he had hatched an ingenious plan to draw her out. 

In their stupor, the quadruple had quite forgotten about the existance of the outside world and each were stunned to find themselves in such a compramizing situation. The doorbell sounded again, Ellie's sobbing subsided, as did Nancy's indignation. Leaving his wife on the ground Adonnis composed himself and strode out of the room to answer the door. The bell rang twice more as he went down the stairs, clearly something was the matter. 

As he opened the door he was greeted by a panic stricken man "Fire! Fire! There's a fire! Quick, grab a bucket of water and follow the smoke! There's a fire of Oxford street!", the man said before running to the neighbouring house's doorbell. 

Jason watched from the shadow of the opposite alleyway as the Adonnis, the Young's cook Santi, Nancy, Arpie, their maid Felipe, and Ellie, ran out of their house in that order carrying buckets of water. He could not help but notice that the inhabitants of the Young house looked somewhat disheartened, though perhaps this was to be expected given that they thought their neighbourhood was on fire.

**Afterword.**

Dear friends at Columbae. I hope that I have not slandered anyone in this piece of *fiction*, and that you where enteretained by it. For the record Addonis I don't think that you're supersticious or sexist but I'm sure you'd make a great pilot, Ellie you're awesome, I don't think you'll ever be a jealous housewife wife, Arpie I think you're more likely to get hurt by your partner than to hurt them yourself, Nancy you're great, Jason I don't think you would ever stoop so low as to court a married woman, and Tuesday I think you would make an excellent postman. 

Thank you everyone so much for your boundless kindness and hospitality. I hope this little piece was as entertaining for you to read as it was for me to write. 

-Steve
