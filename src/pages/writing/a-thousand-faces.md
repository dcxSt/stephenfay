<poem>
Weaving in and out,<br/> 
in and out.<br/> 
The passers bye flow by,<br/> 
In and out,<br/> 
in and out.<br/> 
<br/> 
A thousand garments,<br/> 
a thousand statements,<br/> 
a thousand disguises;<br/> 
A thousand truths,<br/> 
a thousand lies:<br/> 
A thousand of God's faces.<br/> 
<br/> 
The bell strikes three.
</poem>
