*All the humans have left now. The little animals are gathered around the camp-fire, gazing up at the stars.*

**Wren** Do you know what you want to do?

**Fox** Do I know what I want to do? That's a loaded question that one can interpret with varying degrees of social baggage. I have some ideas but I find it hard to know which are my own and which have been acquired mimetically. Is what I do the means to the end of what I want or is it the doing that is the thing that I want. I feel like I have something to prove to the world. Or to myself. 

**Fox** My ego creates an image of it's self and asks me to project it into other people's brains. And I do what I can, sometimes, often I indulge it, and I think that's all right. But it's not always straight forward because it also tries to hide from me. It hides in plain sight.

*Crickets are chirping*

**Leemur** I was listening to Boards of Canada in the quiet after a long journey, observing the dark shadow between the wooden beam and the attic ceiling two meters above my nose. I felt like Francis Bacon's self portrait. 

*all the information that a person accumulates in a lifetime, a drop in the ocean*

**Robin** He's killed people. And he no longer wants to sing. 

**Beaver** Poor boy. He's ever so handsome.

**Tortoise** Memories are in the past, they are not in the present. 

**Achilese** Memories are not able to recieve love. Love is in the present. 

**Stingray** You are correct in that love is a condition that exists only in the present. I don't really know what you mean to say by that they are not able to recieve it. 

**Achilese** She loved in the past, but I cannot love her now that she has gone there. And yet I long to. 

**Jaques the Horse** Love is a condition devoid of selfhood and otherhood. You may not be able to love with her as you once did. But love is not going anywhere, love is as solid as boredom. 

*Beaver draws from his pipe and blows an emaculate smoke-ring*

**Fox** Tomorow, and tomorow, and tomorow.

**Bill the Rhino** Life is a fool, and a stage upon which he frets.

**Stingray** The fool often has the last word.
