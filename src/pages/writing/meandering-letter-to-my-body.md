Dear body,

Thanks for carrying me around the place. Who am I to be carried by you? Perhaps it's presumptuous to think of us as seperate enetities. Maybe you would object if you had the capacity to. 

Watching Robert Sapolsky's lectures has made me aware of just how much leverage you have over me. The ideal situation would be for us to get along, I take care of you and you take care of me. If I don't take care of you you'll react by limiting my physical performance and states of mind.

Are you an interface that allows me to take in sensory data from the outside world. Paraphrasing Alan Watts - the only things that I know, the only things I have ever experianced are states of my nervous system. Every experiance of mine corresponds to the state of a nervous system which presumably grew into me. 

(a) how can I know that this current state was caused by something before it -- how can I know that there is a past or a future from the present moment? (b) how can I know that other people exist?

It seems obvious to me that there is something wrong with these statements. Lets start with (a).

(a) Because the present without the past or the future is meaningless. Unless you happen to know the hamiltonian, taking a spacelike slice of your system tells you nothing! How can you have motion without time, how can you have anything without time. I don't know. On the one hand, time makes a lot of sense, we have atomic clocks and are able to use these instruments to build things. Every time a sattelite locates someone with GPS our ideas about the GR and time are validated. On the other hand time is fickle. Time flies, time births and destroys empires. Time makes you old and kills you in some sense. In modern culture we think of time as a resource to be used and spent wisely. This is an instrumental definition.

(b) Clarification: "state of my nervous system" is just a way of describing "state of mind". Somehow it feels more explicit. It implying the outside world. This kind of language implies that there are entities outside of yourself. 

In some sense I am contained within a body, and in some sense the outside world is not me. But clearly we interact. Things go from the outside world into me and things from inside me manifest in the outside world through my actions. Take this letter for instance. I'm sitting here and my thoughts are being etched onto my harddisk in such a way that will be inteligible to another human, perhaps to future me. If all the humans suddenly all die, these markings on my harddisk will be as meaningless as a rock at the bottom of the ocean.

Another reason for their existance is that writing enables thoughts to flow, so really they have a dual meaning: (1) their shapes on the hard disk, but also in (2) the fact that they passed through me and will alter me. 

Why do I bother to have these thoughts or to write them down? Is it because this is just what I feel like doing right now? Is it because having these thoughts is meaningful to me? Hmmm... no neither of those reasons are satisfying.

It seems there are two somewhat similar but slightly different meanings of the word meaning: (1) as used above, something that is intelligible (2) something that has moral value. 

"I can only judge those things which I understand, and I can only act on my limited understanding and within my sphere of influence" - something about this statement isn't quite right. What do you understand? I understand that the world is a highly chaotic place. I don't mean that as an insult to the world --I mean it in the mathematical sense in chaos theory. The smallest action might completely change the world. But there are so many small actions being done all the time how can you possibly say that one small action is important? That's not what I said, you're missing the point, actions, small actions should not be viewed as unimportant true, BUT I am saying that those who say "this action is small, this action is great, this action is good, this action is bad" are often falling prey to the cognitive biase WYSIATI 'what you see is all there is'.

Complexity, chaos and WYSIATI are the ultimate killers of rationalism and utilitarianism. That's not to say that the utilitarians are wrong about everything. In fact in many cases they're really onto something. But as an over-arching philosophy only the miopic can hold the view that actions should be judged in terms of their consequences, those who think they can do this are not aware of just how complicated and mysterious reality is. Neumann said "If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is."

In the end, the moral compas of even the utilitarians was crafted by the blind watchmaker, and if you want to get down with the dao you must learn, love, and follow your compas. When it comes to judging others' actions don't ignore the deep deep complexity of reality. 

If you like vortices that spin clockwise, then generate vortices that spin clockwise, it is likely that they will propagate and perhaps multiply. But if by misfortune your clockwise spinning vortices start to spin anti-clockwise. Well, that just happens sometimes.

Body, it looks like I got caught up in some other stuff there. I think you're a pretty good guy. I'll take care of you.

One final comment about solipsism. The bhuddists have a 'doctrine of no soul' ("atman") which denies dualism or the separation of the self and the other. It also solves the hard problem of consciousnes. It also makes this letter rather meaningless.

As much as I pull your strings you pull mine, to such an extent that we might as well eradicate the artificial boundry I have palced between us and adress this letter to myself.

With love from you.
