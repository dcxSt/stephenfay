# Draft, this piece is unfinished!

Eddy was in his adult body. Next to him was his childhood friend Zed, grown-up, tall, strong. They walked slowly in a vast white indoor artificial space with a high ceiling. Zed was dejected, he doesn't feel at home in that artificiality. Zed likes earth, trees, sunlight.

The room they had entered was huge in every dimension. The walls curved like a jelly bean, bright white, windowless. It resembled an enormous empty mall without shops. The room had no end, stretching beyond their horizon of awareness. They sat down on a couple of purposeless steps that were just there as part of the inhumane design. On the other side, there was a fully equipped gym. A girl hung by the neck, from a hook that was styled in the same way as the rest of the gym equipment.

The two friends didn't notice that she wasn't moving, they barely registered that she existed. They kept talking gloomily as two old friends would in such an arid setting. There was no notion of the time as there was no notion of the outside.

A boy, presumably a friend of the hanging girl, emerged out of a hidden door directly behind the gym. He ran to her in startled panic and lifted her off the hook. As he shook her and checked her vital signs more friends of the girl ran onto the scene in a flurry of confusion. His panicked vocal reaction must have alerted them. Eddy and Zed sat calmly taking the scene in at a distance. It was striking enough to interrupt their conversation.

A few moments passed and then the dread washed over Eddy as if a cold ghost had entered his body. He allowed horror to slowly fill and permeate every morsel every fiber of his being. He didn't oppose it for he knew that he had no choice but to submit to it. Zed and the room disappeared as Eddy retreated into himself completely. He was a mere spectator of his internal experience, a guest in his own mind. Time passed and the horror lingered, slowly oscillating in intensity. He wished he could be sick, he wished for physical pain to relieve the psychological pain. At times it was unbearable but there was nothing to do but wait.

\*\*\*

Eddy was sitting at a desk with a tall, slender, beautiful girl with dark hair by the exit of the math building. The girl had bags under her eyes and sat slightly hunched over in self-doubt. Eddy sat to her left with his upper body half twisted, his left shoulder almost touching the desk, facing her. They were speaking in hushed voices. He was trying to convince her not to worry, but his attempts were not persuasive for he too was worried. His body language signaled shame and jealousy.

Wanting to change the subject Eddy told her about his rent situation. He was four months late on rent but was only mildly troubled by this.

"You *have* to pay your landlady." said the girl. "You signed the lease, she can take you to court if you don't pay." There was frustration in her voice but Eddy was glad that she was no longer doubting herself. He nodded but remained unconvinced.

A large cylindrical tub of white powder sat on the desk next to the girl, about the same volume as two babies. Noticing from his gaze that Eddy's attention had moved from his rent situation to the tub, the girl said "I'm going to give it to old Gin" carrying her frustrated tone into the new context. His expression remained confused. "It's cough medicine" she added.

Suddenly an intelligent-looking, middle-aged man with neatly combed dark brown hair and glasses entered through the double doors immediately behind them. Without slowing down he walked right past them and bellowed "Hellew Mr. Chandler!" in an overly enthusiastic Irish accent, and disappeared around the corner. The harrowing exclamation caused Eddy's upper body to straighten out into an upright pose. The man was back. Wearing the same faint smile on his lips he strode past them once more from the other direction. This time making direct eye contact with Eddy he boomed "Hellew Ms. Qian!" with the same manic intensity as before, and was gone. But his words resonated for a moment longer.

The accent and the man didn't combine well. The girl, Ms. Qian, was jerked out of her frustration and into a state of calm compassion. The man's sudden appearance had been less jarring for her than it had been for Eddy because the man and had not made eye contact with her. She commented on the dissonance between the man and his voice. Eddy, who was now deeply shaken but still reacting emotionally to Ms. Qian's scolding remarks, contradicted her reflexively "He *is* Irish you know". But she was right and Eddy realized his emotional miss-step. He settled his facial expression, and then briefly contorted it into an apologetic frown and shrug of the shoulders while making eye contact with Ms. Qian to let her know that he was sorry. It was a mark of their friendship that they could understand each other in this way.

Deciding to calm himself Eddy gently contracted his diaphragm causing a pressure differential between the outside and his lungs, a stream of fresh air filled them softly as they expanded. He held on to the breath for a second before letting it flood back out through his nose. He wondered why it was that he couldn't smell his out-breath and came up with three pre-verbal theories which if articulated would have been as follows: (1) a damaged sense of smell from smoking, (2) there is no evolutionary advantage to knowing what your out-breath smells like, (3) the brain just ignores it because it smells the same every time. On the second in-breath, his brain didn't fidget as much and he was able to enjoy the sensation of his chest and belly expanding for a brief moment before his attention jumped to the sensation of his eyeballs in their sockets. On the out-breath, he felt his facial muscles sag.

He opened his eyes to find that Ms. Qian was in the process of transforming into Ms. Fé. Their eyes met and he saw himself in them. There was tremendous power in those eyes. Eddy felt as though he had been struck by lightning. Was this divine knowledge?

Ms. Fé had a kind face and wore a simple smile. They got up and left the building through the same double doors that the brown-haired man had gone through. The bright blue sky greeted them with an open heart. Eddy naturally reached out and held Ms. Fé's hand. It was oh so comforting. Her hand was much bigger than his and hung down to his shoulder height. Holding it was bliss. With her spare arm, Ms. Fé cradled the tub of cough medicine.

"Where are we going?" asked little Eddy

"To old Gin's house." said Ms. Fé with the infinite serenity and patience of a mother explaining the most basic tautology to her darling child.

"Does old Gin often get sick?" Eddy piped innocently.

"Yes dear". Ms. Fé stroked the gentle breeze with her voice.

"Why does old Gin often get sick?"

"That's just the way he is my dear," she said. "you and I get pangs of hunger if we don't eat, don't we? Old Gin gets colds instead of hunger." Eddy was looking at his mother's knees as her words radiated into him from above.

He continued cheerfully "I get hungry every day. Almost every day actually, some days I don't get hungry. Once I went the whole day without eating anything at all, until three, no! four o'clock." said Eddy. He looked up to see Ms. Fé's warm smile which eclipsed the sun and filled him with eternal love.

To compensate for his size Eddy had to take two steps for every step that she made. He looked down at his little legs strutting beside this tremendous maternal presence.

When they reached old Gin's Eddy was given a treat as old Gin and Ms. Fé sat down for a game of chess. He loved to watch them play chess even though he didn't understand the rules. There was something tremendously important about the game that captured his imagination.
