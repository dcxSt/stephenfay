<poem>A lady and a man,<br/>
One white one brown,<br/>
Both with hair white,<br/>
Companions in old age. <br/><br/>

Sharing a stroller,<br/>
They make their way,<br/>
In the evening sunlight,<br/>
To a golden tree.<br/><br/>

The old man,<br/>
And his long shaddow,<br/>
Sit down beneath it. <br/><br/>

A smiling young lady,<br/>
In a blue and yellow dress, <br/>
Fluttering at the hems,<br/>
Walks past the old pair,<br/>
And the golden tree,<br/>
With gentle briskness.<br/><br/>

Time goes by,<br/>
Youths whirl in and out,<br/>
Of the frame;<br/><br/>

Eventually,<br/>
The old pair,<br/>
Inch out of the frame,<br/>
Companions in old age.</poem> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
