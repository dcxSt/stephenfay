In his book <i>Godel Escher Bach</i>, Douglas Hofstadter introduces the notion of an <i>active symbol</i>. It's a notion which describes the building blocks of thought. 

> <i>active elements which can store information and transmit it and recieve it from other active elements. Thus we have active symbols, rather than passive typographical symbols. In the brain the rules are mixed right in with the symbols themselves, whereas on paper, the symbols are static entities, and the rules are in our heads. </i>

<i>D.H. -GEB</i>

Thinking can be thought of as the interplay of potentially physically discernable active symbols in your brain. So when you think of cheese some cheesy patterns, i.e. active symbols, form in your mind and are represented in the circuitry of your brain. What makes them active as opposed to passive is that they interact / speak with other active symbols. They are always in flux rather than inert.


The concept of active symbol pins down how many think about their thoughts. Now that we have added 'active symbol' to our arsenal of known words lets use it to examine some zen sayings.

> <i>The five colours make people's eyes blind,\
> The five sounds make people's ears deaf.</i> 

*Zen saying*

Once you've learned to recognize a pattern as part of a mental model the way you percieve reality is altered. There is now a process in your brain involving active symbols that mirrors and predicts it. Pattern recognition is what turns the sea of sensation into discernible entities. For instance 'blue' and 'sky' are sybmols in your model, that enable you to utter facts such as 'the sky is blue', which in turn enables us to communicate usefully with each other.

In the Zen sect people practice taming their active symbols so that they are not active when they don't need to be. Adepts are aware of what their active symbols are doing. They find it easier to control the flow of their thoughts than the rest of us. Control is perhaps the wrong word because it implies a degree of tension. But there is no tension, there is synergy between thought and thinker. 

In fact this is also a bit wrong, What is the thinker? It is yet another active symbol inside of thought. So really what there is synergy between is active symbols. In other words there is no internal conflict. 

However, one mustn't be fooled into thinking this means that some people have no internal conflict or suffering. Everyone suffers sometimes. For some, the internal conflict looks like dipolacy and for others it looks like war.

The above two paragraphs seem contradictory. First we said that people practice zen in order not to have internal conflict. Then we said that everyone has internal conflict regardless of what they practice. Why would anyone practice zen if the task is futile? The answer is that there is a sense in which there is no such thing as inner conflict or inner peace. Synergy between active symbols is something that is percieved by a thinker, therefore it is percieved by a thought, therefore it is an active symbol. The same is true of percieved discord. And what do symbols know about other symbols?

Sometimes they are in harmony. Sometimes they are in dis-harmony. Always, they do exactly what they are supposed to. 

> <i>Don't oppose reality, don't ignore the facts. What is this: my short staff?</i>

*Schuzan*

It's a trick question because opposing reality is akin to stating the fact. If you state the fact 'it is your short staff' you are opposing reality. Not only do you ignore all the other possible facts like, 'your staff is wooden', but even before you make the statement your brain translates the raw experiance into utterable 'facts'. The reality of the experiance is not being lived. In other words your mind is processing active symbols which correspond the the facts you percieve rather than recieving the input without alteration. 

If you never take a break from this kind of analytic thinking your psyche will become tethered to ideas you have about yourself and your place in the world, the ego. Someone with a large ego is constantly 'opposing reality' by interpreting all their experiances as being about them. When someone tells them something they think, What does it have to do with me? Wheras if you say the same thing to a learned nun or a monk they will pay more attention to the sound of your voice and allow their brain to make sense of your words for them.

> <i>Above, not a tile to cover the head; Below, not an inch of ground for the foot. </i>

*Zen saying*

Reality in it's rawness is richer than any model -- in other words: the *active symbols* in your head only partially capture the behaviour of some phenomenon. The purpose of a model is to help us navigate reality, but the trade off is that, things which are not captured by your model will go un-noticed.

> <i>The dear hunter doesn't see the mountain,\
> The miser doesn't see men.</i> 

*Zen saying*

Contemplation can be touching base with the raw input every now and then, being observant and allowing things to reveal themselves to you by means of inaction. And this is central to capital zed Zen. But Zen is also about getting really confused about everything, just for fun.  

If you're trying to put a shoe on but it's laces are already tied up in a knot there are several ways to proceed: you can untie the knot and put the shoe on, you can cut the knot like Alexander the great and weare a shoe with shorter laces, or you can keep tying more and more knots into the laces until there are no laces left and you have no option but to just walk around bare foot. All of these solutions are legitimate, and all of them are zen. Except that nothing which claims to be zen is truely zen.
