She caught sight of the stunning starlight,<br/>
and allowed it to seep through,<br/>
her mind gave way to the steady stream,<br/>
of the night sky’s aesthetic stimulus,<br/>
supplied so strangely by and to,<br/>
her watchful retina,<br/><br/>

She saw the sinews of space it’s self,<br/>
the shapes that sprang from their synergy,<br/>
constellations who’s names, <br/>
she had never spared a thought,<br/>
nothing effable could describe,<br/>
the undistilled splendour of such a sight.<br/><br/>

Bathing in a soothing shower of solace,<br/>
devoid of any sort or semblance,<br/>
of the sanguine squalor she often endured,<br/>
a placid smile spread, <br/>
across lips unaware. <br/><br/>

She stared at heaven, and kept on staring,<br/>
saturated in simplicity recondite,<br/>
so soon she thought, she’d have to leave,<br/>
she’d rather stay and see the fractal,<br/>
incessantly soaring at speeds so slight,<br/><br/>

Suddenly she sought to capture and seal,<br/>
the moment so profound,<br/>
forever, so as not to forget,<br/>
the seamless phases that had lead,<br/>
to these sensations of object-less sympathy,<br/>
but as soon as she pulled out her phone,<br/>
the magic broke.<br/><br/>

The mythical grandeur her mind had conjured,<br/>
existed only behind her eyes,<br/>
already fading as it was projected,<br/>
onto the mechanical rectangle,<br/>
it’s self a sensory organ,<br/>
benign, inert, ambiguous, misleading,<br/><br/>

Slowly, as she emerged out of,<br/>
what was becoming a banal reverie,<br/>
still contemplating the picture,<br/>
a notification lit the screen,<br/>
tempting her out of her world,<br/>
refocusing her on the mundane.<br/><br/>

Bathing in a soothing shower of solace,<br/>
devoid of any sort or semblance,<br/>
of the sanguine squalor that was her life,<br/>
a placid smile had spread,<br/>
across lips so smooth and unaware, <br/>
of their very own existence.<br/><br/>

And before she could begin to grasp,<br/>
the essence of what had come to pass,<br/>
it slithered away, through her fingers,<br/>
down-stream and into the past,<br/>
what seemed so good had lost it’s meaning,<br/>
existence commodified, nature instrumentalised,<br/>
an addiction fuelled to classify,<br/>
feelings forsaken and unthunk thoughts,<br/>
in an attempt to categorise,<br/>
what would otherwise have been,<br/>
a fragment added to her half soul,<br/>
destined to die, forever lost,<br/>
either forgotten or distorted,<br/>
contorted perversely by bad faith,<br/>
under the omnipresent eye,<br/>
that watched over Winston as he slept.<br/><br/>

This is my first poem, I wrote it when I was 17.
