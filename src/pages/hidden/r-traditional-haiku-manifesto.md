### Note of intent (WORK IN PROGRESS) 

This manifesto is to be written in the ruthless style of the communist manifesto so as to expose the hypocricies of mahyana bhuddism (that they have attained so called enlightenment and yet they seek to free all beings etc.). It is a call to arms, it ought to insight everyone to be more zen in the most paradoxical, self-contradictory and violent way possible. The idea is for this to be a true Oscar-Wildian purposeless work of art that none-the-less evokes a powerful sentiment.

Oscar Wild wanted to make things that where beautiful and not useful. But where does the usefulness in objects lie? It can't be in the object it's self it must be in the way in which people use it. To borrow imagery from the Tao-Te-Ching: a chair is made of four legs, a seat and a back-rest, but it's in the empty space above the seat that the usefulness of the chair lies. If the very act of living is beautiful and contains moral value in and of it's self then the chair which partakes in life and living is beautiful, it's part of something beautiful and is therefore useless by Oscar's standards. And he's right because when viewed from this perspective the chair is merely partaking in a process that has no purpose other than it's self. But more broadly Oscar is wrong because considering something as useful or useless is merely a matter of shifting perspectives. 

The above short paragraph is my attempt to reconcile "nothing useless can be truely beautiful" and "art is quite useless".
