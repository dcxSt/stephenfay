> We life together, we act on, and react to, on another; but always and in all circumstances we are by ourselves. The martyres go hand in hand into the arena, they are crucified alone. Embraced, the loverse desperatley try to fuse their insulated extacies into a single self-transcendence; in vain.


A sentece containing beautiful words that I want in my lexica:
> And how can a man at the extreme limits of ectomorphy and cerebrotonia ever put himself in the place of one at the limits of *endomorphy* and *viscerotonia*, or, except within certain circumscribed areas, share the feelings of one who stands at the limits of *mesomorphy* and *somatotonia*?

Page 22:
> "Lo, the poor Indian, whose untutored mind Clothes him in front, but leaves him bare behind."
> But actually it is we, the rich and highly educated whites, who have left ourselves bare behind. We cover our anterior nakedness with some philosophy - Christian, Marxian, Freudo-Physicalist - but abaft we remain uncovered, at the mercy of all the winds of circumstance. The poor Indian, on the other hand has had the wit to prtect his rear by supplementing the fig leaf of a theology with the breachcloth of transcendental experience.
