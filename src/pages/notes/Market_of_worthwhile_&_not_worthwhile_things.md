*Chess*
-\$1 buys you 5 seconds on the clock (without increment). A game with 10 minutes on the clock costs $120, no matter how long it lasts. If you win the game, it gets refunded in full, this gives incentive not to blunder and it will ensure that you get back your money if your opponant blunders and plays a shit game (expected cost of 10 min game is about $59). Add 40x increment seconds when there is an increment. (5 min: \$60, 5 min +3s ~7min: \$84, 15 min: \$180, 15 + 3 ~17min: \$204)

*Youtube/Nebula/Media*
-\$1 per ten seconds of educational video, (1 min: \$6, 5 min: \$30, 10 min: \$60, 30 min: \$180)
-\$1 per four seconds of any media deemed to be of little worth (\$15 for 1 minute, \$150 for 10 minutes, \$900 for an hour)
-\$1 per twenty seconds of podcast (15 min: \$45, 30 min: \$90, 1 hour: \$180)

*Oral Consumption*
-\$80 for an ice cream
-\$5 for the first coffee of the day if it's before noon
-\$60 for a coffee if it's (a) after midday or (b) the second coffee of the day
