#### Advice from [Leo Tunkle](https://www.recurse.com/directory/5071-leo-tunkle)

Anki deck "spoonfed chinese" (its about $2)

> People say "you should make your own cards", but this is the exception. Anki has a feature where you listen to a native speaker and repete the sentences. 
> 
> You can look up how to record yourself on Anki. 

Get a *graded reader*, this one is good: [The Secret Garden: Mandarin Companion Graded Readers Level 1 (Chinese Edition): Yang, Renjun, Burnett, Frances Hodgson, Pasden, John: 9781941875001: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Garden-Mandarin-Companion-Readers/dp/1941875009?tag=fluentu-20) 

It's a book completely in mandarin kept to a very small character set. This is a good way to pick up grammar. 

> Once you can write about ten characters, you should focus more on reading. 
> 
> After you write a few chars focus on reading them.
