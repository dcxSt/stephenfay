> The falseness of a judgement is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgement: it is here that our new language perhaps sounds stranges. The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding; and our fundamental tendency is to assert that the falsest judgements (to which sythetic judgements *a priori* belong) are the most indispensable to us, that without granting as true the fictions of logic, without measuring reality against the purely invented world of the unconditional and self-identical, without a continual flasification of the world by means of numbers, mankind could not live - that to renounce false judgements would be to renounce life, would be to deny life. To recognise untruth as a condition of life: that, to be sure, menas to resist customary value-sentiments in a dangerous fashion; and a philosophy which ventures to do so places itself, by that act along, beyond good and evil.
