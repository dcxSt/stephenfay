It's good never to forget that we are a violent species that has only relatively recently 'risen' to our humanist ideals: (p 44)

> Everywhere at Anyang there was evidence of human sacrifice, piles of skulls and rows of 'beheading acrifices' often taken from subject peoples and from enemies defeated in war. Such captives the oracle bones described as being offered to the spirits of the deceased Shang kings: 'Offering to Da Ding, Da Jia, and Zu Yi, 100 cups of wine, 100 Qiang prisoners, 300 cattle, 300 sheep and 300 pigs'. The animals would be eaten, their bones recycled in bone workshops, while the humans were disposed of in earth pits specially prepared in one part of the royal site. More than 2000 such pits containing human skeletons have been found around the royal tombs at Anyang. But we should not think the early Chinese were uniquely curel in such practices. Human sacrifice is part of many early civilisations and can be found in pre-dynastic Egypt, the Royal Tombs at Ur, Bronze Age Crete, and of course the Central American and Inca civilisations. Ritual killing of human being sis part of the human story, and the priest and the executioner have gone hand in hand for much of history, indeed long after the formal end of human sacrifice as such. To understand ourselves, to see the ways in which humanity has evolved, it is something we need to see as part of the evolution of civilisation, the long, slow Ascent of Man, if such it is.
